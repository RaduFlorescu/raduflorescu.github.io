This is my first post! I will leave here my experience in achieving my goals as a consultant, developer, coach and architect in the next few years.

In order to achieve this, I need to improve my skills, knowledge and things I need to know about not knowing. I’ve had a marvelous experience at SDDConf and the information discovered there made me think about what more is out there that I really don’t know I don’t know. So this is a discovery and self discovery in order to achieve my goals.

The road map starts here and the goals is to discover new knowledge about tools and technologies and post findings in here.

First thing about starting this journey is to document a little bit on the ones that made me think about the necessary discovery and learning of new technologies in achieving my goals.

Neil Ford, Mark Richards, Sam Newman and Allen Holub made me think on the fact that a developer is not a set of skills, he is more than that, and he evolves and needs  to apply the things he learns on other technologies. A developer most not stop developing and trying new things that better suits his goals and might help the development of better applications.

Books to read in order to decide on the road map of the evolution start with this book: Software Architecture Fundamentals: Understanding the Basics and will continue with <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920033158.do">Build microservices</a>
